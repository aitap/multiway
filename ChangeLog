Changes from ver 1.0-0 to ver 1.0-1     [Aug-26-2015]
   1) multiway-package
	*   Speed-ups for indscal, parafac, and parafac2
	*   congru: new function to calculate Tucker's congruence coefficient
	*   Changes in convergence tolerance for all functions
	*   Can now output all random starts (instead of only best)
	*   Renamed function "nrescale" to "nscale" ("nrescale" still works)
	*   Added "reorder" functionality for all methods
	*   Added "rescale" functionality for all methods
	*   Added "resign" functionality for all methods
	*   Bug fixes for SCA-IND model with type="sca-ecp"
	*   More customizability for parafac2 (fixed correlation structures)
   2) congru
	*   New function to calculate Tucker's congruence coefficient
	*   Functionality is similar to cor and cov functions in R
   3) indscal
	*   Improvements to internals (speed-ups)
	*   Now uses change in R^2 to determine ALS convergence
	*   Default convergence tolerance now 10^-4
	*   Can now output all random starts (instead of only best)
	*   Can use "reorder" to reorder factors of fit INDSCAL model
	*   Can use "rescale" to rescale factors of fit INDSCAL model
	*   Can use "resign" to resign factors of fit INDSCAL model
   4) parafac
	*   Improvements to internals (speed-ups)
	*   Now uses change in R^2 to determine ALS convergence
	*   Default convergence tolerance now 10^-4
